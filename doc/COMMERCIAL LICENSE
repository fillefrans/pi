COMMERCIAL LICENSE


The Commercial License has the following conditions:

You may not force or directly pay any of your employees to grant you a 
gratis license under the Programmer's License.

When one of your employees publishes code to the open source
repository of the official pi branch, he has a right to
personally collect all earnings accruing to the commercial 
use of that code.


You may not use this software or any part of 
it's source code without prior written with Views, 
as identified in this document.


The normal conditions are that if you use pi as an application
platform where clients pay to access that application, you have to 
either use the payment system integrated in the software, or pay 10% of 
any and all access fees, however they are structured, as a license fee to 
Views, or a third-party selected by Views.

In addition there is a fee for resource usage by the software. Views will
charge a small fee for use of CPU time, network bandwith, memory and storage

This means that you will pay license fees as a small overhead on your 
server and hosting costs, typically as a percentage of that cost
